ACDC Best song :

Livin' easy Lovin' free
Season ticket on a one way ride
Askin' nothin'
Leave me be
Takin' everythin' in my stride
Don't need reason
Don't need rhyme
Ain't nothin' that I'd rather do
Goin' down
Party time
My friends are gonna be there too
I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
No stop signs
Speed limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel
Gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me around
Hey satan
Payin' my dues
Playin' in a rockin' band
Hey mumma
Look at me
I'm on the way to the promised land
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
Don't stop me
I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
(highway to hell) I'm on the highway to hell
(highway to hell) highway to hell
(highway to hell) highway to hell
(highway to hell)
And I'm goin' down
All the way
I'm on the highway to hell


Metallica best song:

Yt, come on
(Enter night)
Grain of sand
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
Off to never-never land
Yeah, yeah, yeah
We're off to never-never land
Take my hand
We're off to never-never land
Take my hand
We're off to never-never land
Thank you very much, France
That felt good, man, thanks for coming on down here, man
Making us feel good
